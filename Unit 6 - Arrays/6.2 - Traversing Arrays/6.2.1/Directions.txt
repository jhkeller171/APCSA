You do NOT need to create a class, complete everything in main.



Declare an integer array of size 5 and assign the values 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 to it.



Then use a for loop to print out all the elements of the array, one per line, with a space between elements.



Repeat a 2nd time, print the elements in reverse order one per line, with a space between elements.



Example output:

10 20 30 40 50 

50 40 30 20 10
