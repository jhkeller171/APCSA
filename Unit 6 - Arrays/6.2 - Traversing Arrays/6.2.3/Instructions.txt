In the main section of the program, create two String Arrays (first and last) each should hold 4 names (first names in first, last names in last). Initialize the arrays with proper names.

You MUST declare an empty String array to store the returned array.



Create a static combineNames method to return a new String array that is composed of the first name and last name of each of the parameters.



When calling the method, the actual parameters are simply the name of the array you want to pass (first). For the formal parameters, you must

specify the data type String[] variable name. Also return the data type must be String[].



Finally, print the contents of the returned array in the main section.



This may be confusing so look at the example:

first_names = {"bob","joe"}

last_names = {"jones","smith"}

returns a new String array with {"bob jones", "joe smith"}



Example output:

bob jones

joe smith
