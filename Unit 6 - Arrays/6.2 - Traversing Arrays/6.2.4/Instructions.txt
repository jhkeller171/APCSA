The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, â€¦



The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.



For example, the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1). The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2). 

The 5 is found by adding the two numbers before it (2+3), and so on! Each number in the sequence is called a term.



You need to::

Create the array int[] sequence that will hold the values of the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. 

Think carefully about what happens to the index when iterating through the loop to fill this array. Read the Fibonacci description above to help!

For the 1st 2 numbers in the array, simply use the index and assign to 0 and 1 as shown.   sequence[0] = 0

The remainder of the values should be calculated and added to the array using a loop.

Once the array is created, print out the heading and then the sequence of numbers separated by a space.

Print out all the even numbers in the array, label output as shown.

Next, print out all the numbers at odd indices, label as shown.

Finally, create a method findIndex to find the index of the term 233.



Example output:
